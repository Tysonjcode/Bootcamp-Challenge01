UWA Bootcamp Challenge 1 Readme - Search Engine Optimisation 

In this challenge we had to I complete a project by using a base code of HTML and CSS and tried to use semantic HTML elements, elements that have structure, alt image tags and other web design techniques to  have a code base that follows accessibility standards that help optimise the website for search engines. This all needed to be done while making sure the web sites styling and design was not altered or affect by any HTML or CSS changes I made.

The website is a digital marketing agency website that consists of "Search Engine Optimisation", "Online Reputation Management" and "Social Media Marketing". The website consists of a header at the top of the page with a title and 3 navigation selections which when clicked link to the content in the body sections. Webpage also consists of a hero image which takes up  majority of the top page, in the body which is linked to from the navigation bar in the header consists of three section elements and one aside element. The elements consist of information on the topics of "Search Engine Optimisation", "Online Reputation Management" and "Social Media Marketing" with images to suit. The aside element consists of three sub topics of "Lead Generation", "Brand Awareness" and "Cost Management" with icons and information on the topics. This is all followed by a Footer element which describes whose made the website and company stamp.
